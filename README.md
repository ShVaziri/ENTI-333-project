# ENTI-333-project


* Few ideas to improve the website:
  1. Adding a comment option for the users where people can see eachother's feedbacks on the website and a rating for each user where they can be differentiated.
  2. We could add a support chatbot where users can provide feedback regarding the web application's issues and ideas for improvement.
  3. Adding another service where people can provide services such as tutoring, graphic design and other freelance jobs through the school's community (issues regarding integrity might be created as the website would be the way to connect these people to each other and we must make sure there is a verification process and if that individual can actually deliver.).
  4. Providing a news feed with school news regarding things happening on campus (possible collaboration with the university's unions and clubs)
  5. Providing a recently added section in the main page so it looks less dull.
  6. Any graphical recommendations would be welcome and we can discuss on the next meeting!
  7. Adding a terms and condition to the signing up part to protect the website against legal issues that might arise within the platform.
